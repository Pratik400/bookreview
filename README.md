1. Basic Webpages and Content. (6 marks)
On the School's designated web server, create a website of your own, consisting of at least a home page and some other interrelated pages, to demonstrate proper page linking similar to a menu, as well as those to be outlined below gradually.

This site should be about the various books on modern computing or IT technologies, featuring their respective prominent technological aspects and their corresponding applicability in the IT industry.

One of these pages, or just a section of one of these pages, should be somewhat about yourself, the creator of this site, your former study and/or work experience and perhaps your career goal, if possible.

Include some transparent and non-transparent graphics, different text sizes and colours, some form of itemisation, at least one table illustrative of all the major table features, and various layouts using HTML5.







2. Cascading Style Sheets. (4 marks)
    - assets/css/style2.css
    - assets/css/style1.css


3. Forms, Queries, and Data Collection. (8 marks)

There are 3 aspects in this section. 

The first is to have a proper form set up for the interface on a webpage, 
the second is to have proper Javascript for the interactivity (e.g. clicking a button, or making an item selection or directly submitting a form, will fire up a database query), 
and the third is to make use of a PHP script to query the database to return/display the results. Create a form so that a user can select a book to list all the relevant reviewers and their respective ratings described either in bookreview.sql, or in a similar database of your own if you wish to use different or more features or fields in the database.


4. Exploratory Challenges. (2 marks) Add one of the following aspects or features to your website that is not explicitly stated as the requirements in the above. These aspects or features are A fancy or state-of-art navigation scheme for your site, making more sophisticated use of CSS; An additional Javascript application, making use of DOM, to improve the interactivity or data processing; A facility on your website to modify an existing table record in the database. Student must explicitly state which part of their submitted work belongs to this subsection. 

- Responsive Navbar, small animations on buttons
- Dynamic Add/remove author when submitting a new book
- Inserting in to 3 tables (book, author and authorship) from a single form
- AJAX Search
- Poseudo code css for Buttons and Page header
- Storing sessions to manage user logins
- Using localstorage to store the css variable 

5. Overall Quality and Professionalism. (20% of the total marks) About 20% of the total marks will be awarded for the top quality of the submitted work as well as to the professionalism demonstrated there. These are typically expected to go beyond the minimal features already explicitly stated in the above subsections of REQUIREMENTS. The overall quality can include, among others, the look and feel, the ease on the use of the site, as well as the professional/proficient design and implementation throughout the student work. Students may be recommended to demonstrate some of their most impressive features during the class of the submission week, if time permits, but this part is subject to changes or cancellation.
